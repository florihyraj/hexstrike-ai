# Vulnerability Assessment: edepo.fsdksh.gov.al

Date: 2026-02-24

Scope & Authorization
- Target: https://edepo.fsdksh.gov.al
- Authorization: provided by user in-session (explicit permission to run passive and light active scans).

Executive summary
- Performed passive checks (TLS/cert inspection, headers) and a light active TCP scan (ports 1-1024 non-aggressive). Key issues discovered:
  - TLS certificate hostname mismatch (certificate CN is for a different host).
  - Missing common security response headers (CSP, HSTS, X-Frame-Options, X-Content-Type-Options, X-XSS-Protection).
  - Large number of open TCP ports in 1-1024 range (broad attack surface).

Actions performed (commands)
```bash
echo | openssl s_client -connect edepo.fsdksh.gov.al:443 -servername edepo.fsdksh.gov.al 2>/dev/null | openssl x509 -noout -dates -subject -issuer -serial -fingerprint
curl -k -I https://edepo.fsdksh.gov.al
nmap -sT -p 1-1024 -Pn -T3 edepo.fsdksh.gov.al
```

Findings (detailed)

1) TLS certificate hostname mismatch — High
- Evidence (cert details):
```
notBefore=Oct  9 00:00:00 2025 GMT
notAfter=Oct 12 23:59:59 2026 GMT
subject=CN=ereceta.fsdksh.gov.al
issuer=C=US, O=DigiCert Inc, OU=www.digicert.com, CN=RapidSSL TLS RSA CA G1
serial=0B5AC157988674838D848A3B5A71484E
SHA1 Fingerprint=9C:C1:DF:82:3E:AF:72:CC:50:21:BF:A3:AB:9C:12:DF:7E:8C:20:DE
```
- Impact: Clients validating hostnames will fail TLS verification for `edepo.fsdksh.gov.al`. This breaks browsers, API clients, and integrations; it can cause users to bypass verification (bad) or block connections.

2) Missing security response headers — Medium
- Evidence (response headers):
```
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Connection: close
Cache-Control: no-cache
Content-Type: text/html; charset=utf-8
Pragma: no-cache
Content-Length: 188
```
- Observed: no `Strict-Transport-Security`, no `Content-Security-Policy`, no `X-Frame-Options`, no `X-Content-Type-Options`, no `X-XSS-Protection`.
- Impact: Increases exposure to clickjacking, MIME-sniffing attacks, and client-side content injection risks.

3) Many open TCP ports (1-1024 scan) — High (attack surface)
- Evidence (excerpt from `nmap`):
```
Nmap scan report for edepo.fsdksh.gov.al (134.0.63.188)
Host is up (0.047s latency).

PORT     STATE SERVICE
80/tcp   open  http
22/tcp   open  ssh
25/tcp   open  smtp
443/tcp  open  https
...
Nmap done: 1 IP address (1 host up) scanned in 24.74 seconds
```
- Impact: Numerous services exposed may not all be required publicly. Each open service increases the potential for exploitation; services must be inventoried and hardened.

Notes & caveats
- Some open ports may be due to network devices or filtering that respond to probes; further service fingerprinting (`nmap -sV`) is recommended to identify exact software versions.
- The `curl` client initially failed hostname verification (see TLS mismatch). Using `-k` returned a 200, showing the site responds over HTTPS despite the cert mismatch.

Immediate remediation (high priority)
1. Fix TLS certificate: obtain/renew a certificate that covers `edepo.fsdksh.gov.al` (include it in SANs) and verify chain/trust with browsers and `openssl`.
2. Add security headers:
   - `Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=63072000; includeSubDomains; preload`
   - `X-Frame-Options: SAMEORIGIN`
   - `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff`
   - `Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'self';` (tune per app)
3. Inventory and restrict exposed services: close unnecessary ports at firewall level; run `nmap -sV` to identify running services and patch/harden them.

Recommended next tests (explicit permission required)
- `nmap -sV -p <critical_ports>` for version detection of services confirmed open (non-intrusive).
- OWASP ZAP active scan against targeted application paths to find XSS, CSRF, auth flaws.
- `sqlmap` targeted test against specific parameters (explicit URL + param required) with `--safe-url`/`--skip-waf` flags as appropriate.
- TLS audit (`sslyze`/`sslscan`) for cipher suite and protocol strength.

Appendix B — Repro steps
- To reproduce these checks locally (from an authorized host):
```bash
echo | openssl s_client -connect edepo.fsdksh.gov.al:443 -servername edepo.fsdksh.gov.al 2>/dev/null | openssl x509 -noout -dates -subject -issuer -serial -fingerprint
curl -k -I https://edepo.fsdksh.gov.al
nmap -sT -p 1-1024 -Pn -T3 edepo.fsdksh.gov.al
```

If you'd like, I can:
- Convert this markdown to PDF and attach it here, or
- Run the next authorized test (`nmap -sV` on specific ports, targeted `sqlmap` test, or an OWASP ZAP scan).
